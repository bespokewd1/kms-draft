**Testing Your Sump Pump:**

1. To test the sump pump simply unplug the cords from the receptacle. 
2. Then take the cord that was plugged into the back of the first cord and plug directly into the receptacle. 
3. You should hear the sump pump running at this point and the water level starting to go down.
4. Once the test is complete and you hear the pump running and water level go down replace the cords the way you found them originally in the receptacle.
